<div class="content"> <h2>Why "move while you can" ?</h2> <p
style="margin-bottom:2em;"> Well, why the hell not? Our bodies were meant to
move, run, jump, dance etc, so why are you just sitting there? I don't blame
you, the problem is that today's life is very different from back in the days
when were hunters and gatherers. Most of us now are sitting for over 8 hours a
day, hunched back in our chairs and staring at screens. It's no wonder that we
have back pains, are constantly fatigued and don't know how to activate certain
muscles (When is the last time you felt your glute muscles?).  Making even the
smallest adjustment to your life can make all of the difference, for example
elevators and escalators are all man made, try to avoid them when you can. Just
move! I want to help you awaken your body and show you functional movements that
will make your day to day life easier. We're all meant to be strong and active
regardless of age, so move while you can.  </p>

        "Leonora was my personal trainer for seven months. From the beginning she was very friendly which made the sessions very enjoyable. Her good sense of humor was accompanied by a great sense of responsibility as she was always prepared for our training sessions and knew which type of exercises I would benefit most from. I would strongly recommend Leonora as she is a caring and inspirational personal trainer.",
        "Leonora is a fun, easy-going person and training with her has been a really positive experience - I feel physically stronger, more health-conscious and also better able to harness my self-discipline and  motivation. I always feel pushed and challenged without ever feeling out  of my depth – Leonora is a very astute coach who is able to judge what  each individual is capable of and ready for. I always leave feeling healthy and energized, which not only improves my physical well-being but also helps in other areas of my life. Great stuff, great value for money - definitely signing up for more!",
        "I love training with Leonora! High intensity and tailored workouts, which you can even do right in  your own living room – so there’s no excuse! Leonora’s a real expert, with a focus on proper form, good nutrition and hitting the right level  of intensity for the best results. I can see and feel a big change after 3 months already, and the best part is it was enjoyable (burpees aside…)!  If you want to get fitter and stronger, and learn how to train  properly, try this!",
        "I loved training with Leonora for almost a year. First of all, she's an expert and knows her subject. She can adapt the exercices to the person and even with a knee injury I could do a session every week. We worked on different intensity and parts of the body.<br> It was a great experience. Then she's very friendly, smiling and she knows how to motivate people and push the limits exactly where we need to. Unfortunately we had to stop our sessions because I moved back home. Now I can do the exercices in my living room and use all her advices. I highly recommend her and if you still hesitate, have a trial session and you will be impressed by her work.",
        "Thanks again for the excellent workout sessions, I loved them and I hope I get to do them again with you! I found them to be really effective - especially in terms of toning up and gaining energy and much needed motivation to continue. I have discovered that I much prefer this kind of exercise over running because it’s short, punchy, diverse and time just flies by! At the end of each workout I really feel like I have achieved something.",
        "Since having a baby, I'd been lacking the motivation and self-discipline to get back into shape. I'm so happy I found Leonora - the tailor-made, high intensity work outs worked my whole body and have really improved my strength and stamina. Leonora also provided excellent advice regarding nutrition so I was able to complement my work outs with healthier eating. The sessions were really fun too; I'd previously thought personal trainers were like angry army officers only shouting at you! But Leonora is really friendly and gives vital encouragement to get you through the final rounds! This is definitely the style of exercise that suits me - each session is over before you know it yet you know you've worked really, really hard. Thanks Leonora!",
        "Leonora was my personal trainer and fitness guide for almost an year while in Düsseldorf, Germany. All my sessions were very enjoyable and upbeat, but what makes working out with Leonora exceptional is her dedication to your fitness goals. I will especially vouch since I have a difficult relationship with food, and Leonora was thorough and yet compassionate throughout. We accomplished so much together. And I have a lot thank her for. Even the slight push and motivation to go on that you need, here and there for those early morning sessions :)"
