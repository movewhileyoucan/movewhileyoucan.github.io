<h3>What should I expect?</h3><br>
After I get a better understanding of your lifestyle and training history, I will create a routine for you that is based on your goals and capabilities. The training will be outdoors and will last 45 minutes.  Be prepared to be pushed and to work hard.  I train no matter rain or shine. <br>

<h3>Where does the training take place?</h3><br>
I can recommend some good and central locations but I can also work with what suits you best. We can work in the area of your home or office, we just need open space in an outdoor environment.<br><br>
<i>Housecalls:</i><br>
Bad weather is a part of life, but it shouldn't stop us from working out. If you have enough space, it is possible to arrange the session in the comfort of your own home.<br>

<h3>What to bring?</h3><br>
A towel and water bottle
